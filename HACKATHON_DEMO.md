# 🌊 zkVerify Hackathon Demo - Privacy-Preserving Dark Pool

## 🎯 Demo Overview

This demo showcases a **complete privacy-preserving dark pool system** with:
- **Hidden order amounts** (cryptographic commitments)
- **Double-spend protection** (nullifiers)  
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** (SP1/Succinct)
- **zkVerify blockchain verification**
- **MEV protection** (no front-running possible)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Anvil running on localhost:8545
- All contracts deployed (see `deployment.json`)
- Node.js and Rust toolchain installed

### Run the Demo

```bash
# Full hackathon demo (presentation + functional)
npm run demo:full

# Or run individually:
npm run demo:hackathon    # Presentation demo
npm run demo:functional   # Live contract interaction
```

## 🎭 What You'll See

### Phase 1: Hidden Order Creation
```
👤 Alice: SELL 100 TokenA (amount HIDDEN)
👤 Bob: BUY 50 TokenB (amount HIDDEN)
👤 Carol: BUY 75 TokenA (amount HIDDEN)

🔒 Commitments generated (Pedersen commitments)
🛡️  Nullifiers created (double-spend protection)
```

### Phase 2: Zero-Knowledge Proofs
```
🔬 SP1 proof generation:
  • Validates hidden order amounts
  • Proves balance sufficiency
  • Ensures nullifier uniqueness
  • Generates zkVerify-compatible proof
```

### Phase 3: zkVerify Integration
```
🌐 zkVerify blockchain submission:
  • Connects to zkVerify testnet
  • Submits SP1 proof for verification  
  • Receives cryptographic receipt
  • Enables decentralized verification
```

### Phase 4: Private Settlement
```
🤖 Operator processing:
  • Finds CoW matches (amounts still hidden)
  • Consumes nullifiers (prevents replay)
  • Settles trades privately
  • No MEV extraction possible
```

## 🛡️ Privacy Guarantees Demonstrated

- **Order Amounts**: Completely hidden using Pedersen commitments
- **Trader Identity**: Protected through nullifier schemes
- **Settlement**: Private CoW matching without public exposure
- **MEV Protection**: No visible information for bots to exploit

## 🔬 Technical Features Showcased

### Commitment Scheme
```javascript
// Pedersen commitment: C = r*G + amount*H
commitment = hash(amount + trader + blinding_factor)
```

### Nullifier Generation
```javascript
// Prevents double-spending
nullifier = hash(private_key + commitment_hash)
```

### SP1 Proof Validation
- Validates commitments without revealing amounts
- Proves balance sufficiency privately
- Ensures nullifier uniqueness
- Creates zkVerify-compatible proof format

### zkVerify Integration
- Submits proofs to specialized ZK verification blockchain
- Receives tamper-proof verification receipts
- Enables decentralized proof validation
- Integrates with AVS for operator responses

## 📊 Business Impact

### For Institutions
- **Large orders** can be executed without market impact
- **Trading strategies** remain completely private
